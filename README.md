## Plan
In our investigation of the ProtoQA task, we will begin by researching the existing solutions to the task. Some of these are provided in the original paper for ProtoQA, and others are described in the submissions on the public leaderboard. We will look further on Google Scholar for research related to ProtoQA (and more generally, commonsense reasoning in NLP). This initial research will take around 1 week.
From this research, we will determine the most effective solution for us to pursue, evaluating existing solutions based on how accurately they can accomplish the task, as well as feasibility for us to extend and innovate on top of, in terms of cost, time, and complexity. During this stage of the project, we will prototype/experiment with potential solutions to aid in determining feasibility. This step of experimenting and deciding on our solution will take around 1.5 weeks.
Finally, we will implement our solution in the remaining weeks. This will involve fully fleshing out a complete design to proceed with. We will then implement this design, and iterate on our solution to improve its performance. We will aim to submit at least 10 days before the deadline, so that we have time to make a second submission if necessary (you can only submit once every 7 days to avoid overfitting on the test set).
